# Open Image in Kaleidos Context-Menu Extension

This extension adds a context-menu item to open an image in the lovely http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/. It tries to be simple, but is probably loaded with bugs.

Install the pre-packaged ones or hack them and package them yourself (will require generating keys for Chrome, certificates for Safari, or zipping and renaming to .oex for Opera).

What about Firefox? According to [http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2012/11/28/jetpack-project-weekly-update-for-november-28-2012/](http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2012/11/28/jetpack-project-weekly-update-for-november-28-2012/), the Context-Menu API was just rewritten and will be ready for the 1.13 SDK (current stable as of Dec 9 is 1.11). So like, pull requests welcome.
